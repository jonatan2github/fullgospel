    <h3>Receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost</h3>
    <img src="holy-ghost.jpg">
    <p>If you have followed the order on the first page you have learned that we are to have faith in Him, repent through him, make a two-way promise with him but that is really your part. His part comes in this step and that is through giving you the companionship of the Holy Ghost, even someone that can comfort you in whatever situation you are in. If you promise to have faith, to repent and continue making a two-way promise every week you are promised that this influence will be with you throughout your life.</p>
    <p>As you can see on the picture above two men puts their hands on someone's head and gives a blessing. Sometime in that blessing they will say "receive the Holy Ghost"</p>
    <h4>Who are they</h4>
    <p>These two men are representatives of Jesus Christ, representing him in commanding the person making the commitment to receive the Holy Ghost. Of this the Prophet Joseph Smith said: "“You might as well baptize a bag of sand as a man, if not done in view of the remission of sins and getting of the Holy Ghost. Baptism by water is but half a baptism, and is good for nothing without the other half- that is, baptism of the Holy Ghost.” Without his part of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, it is good for nothing.</p>
